# Bootprompt - Bootstrap powered alert, confirm and flexible dialog boxes

Please see [URL TBA] for full usage instructions.

Bootprompt is a fork of Nick Payne's
[Bootbox](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox). In 2018-2019 people began
asking for a release of Bootbox compatible with Bootstrap 4. [Tieson
Trowbridge](https://github.com/tiesont) put together a version 5 of Bootbox that
worked with Bootstrap 4. Unfortunately, Tieson did not have release powers and
Nick was no longer active on Github and it seemed that the release of Bootbox 5
would never happen. Louis-Dominique Dubeau, after consultation with Tieson,
decided to fork the project, and Bootprompt was born.
