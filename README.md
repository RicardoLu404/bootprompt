# Bootprompt - Bootstrap powered alert, confirm and flexible dialog boxes

Please see [URL TBA] for full usage instructions.

Bootprompt is a fork of Nick Payne's
[Bootbox](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox). In 2018-2019 people began
asking for a release of Bootbox compatible with Bootstrap 4. [Tieson
Trowbridge](https://github.com/tiesont) put together a version 5 of Bootbox that
worked with Bootstrap 4. Unfortunately, Tieson did not have release powers and
Nick was no longer active on Github. So it seemed that a formal release of
Bootbox 5 would never happen. Louis-Dominique Dubeau, after consultation with
Tieson, decided to fork the project, and Bootprompt was born.

## Versioning

Bootprompt's first version is 5 because Bootbox got up to version 4 before
Bootprompt was forked from it. If we had restarted version numbering from 1, we
would have had to rename tags, etc. Too much trouble.

Do note that this project does not provide support for any version prior to 5.

## Support

Bootprompt is developed by volunteers. Given our limited resources, we have to
limit the scope of what we formally support.

### JavaScript packages

Bootprompt supports:

* Bootstrap 4
* Bootstrap 3.4.x
* The same range of jQuery versions as supported by Bootstrap 4.

### Browsers

Bootprompt supports the same range of browsers as Bootstrap 4. Note that
Bootstrap 4 dropped support from some old browsers that Bootstrap 3
supported. For instance, IE 9.

#### Browser Testing

for free under their program for supporting open-source software.
